## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS

I Wanted the website to feel modern and responsive so I added a lot of behavior functions in javascript css, scss, Everthing has a rule to it and depending on your device and size this website will feel different,
I went with the classic black and white for displaying quality products to the user, The client wanted to express the quality sercice they provide and i put his dreams and hopes into this website.
I Also focused on the user experience in this website. everythinghas a purpose and is easily navigated, 
This website has a alot of integrations with google, facebook and other services to have it all in one place kind of deal

## Optimizations
In the future i want to transfer the code from vanilla js to node.js, express.js and react.js


## Lessons Learned:

No matter how hard i tried it was very hard to intagrate facebook booking system in this website. I finally decided to go with another booking method and it made it much easyear
